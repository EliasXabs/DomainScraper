# DomainScraper
A simple python script to scrape subdomains, directories, files from a list of websites.
It saves the output into three different files, you can change the input int the potential folder. Make sure they have the same name.
- The script is not very fast, it takes a while to scrape a website. (Since it uses a large ammount of inputs)

## Usage
```bash
python3 domainscraper.py -h
python3 test_script.py http://www.example.com
```

## Requirements
- Python 3
```bash
pip install requests
```
